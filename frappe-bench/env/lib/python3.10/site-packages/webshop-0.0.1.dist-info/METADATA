    ```
4. After that, you can install the webshop app on the required site by running

## Usage
Once setup has been completed, eCommerce features can be set up. This [guide](https://docs.erpnext.com/docs/user/manual/en/set_up_e_commerce) explains how to begin setup of the eCommerce features in conjunction with ERPNext. Many common features and customization options are explained, providing a solid framework for users to get started with building their eCommerce platforms. Note that for best results, users should have some Items setup using ERPNext before attempting to create a store. Creating items is a simple process that can be done through the Webshop interface by accessing > Home > Stock > Items and Pricing > Item.
